[   39690ms] [WARNING] [Fast Refresh] performing full reload

Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules outside of the React rendering tree.
You might have a file which exports a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it into both files.

It is also possible the parent component of the component you edited is a class component, which disables Fast Refresh.
Fast Refresh requires at least one parent function component in your React tree. @ webpack-internal:///(app-pages-browser)/./node_modules/next/dist/client/components/react-dev-overlay/app/hot-reloader-client.js:112
