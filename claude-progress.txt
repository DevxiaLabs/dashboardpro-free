===== SESSION (Feature #159) - 2026-02-11 =====

## Completed
- Feature #159: Error - "missing required error components, refreshing..." at localhost:3000 ✅
  - Root cause: corrupted .next build cache from many development sessions
  - Fix: killed hung dev server, deleted .next directory, restarted dev server
  - Verified: navigating to localhost:3000 now correctly redirects to /login
  - Login page renders with full form: email, password, Sign In, social login, etc.
  - Zero console errors
  - Server compiles cleanly: / route (200), /login route compiled successfully

## Implementation Notes
- No code changes required - the error.tsx, global-error.tsx, and not-found.tsx files were all correctly structured
- The "missing required error components" is a known Next.js 14 issue caused by stale/corrupted .next cache
- The fix is clearing .next and restarting the dev server
- All error boundary components verified correct: error.tsx (route-level), global-error.tsx (app-level), not-found.tsx (404)

  - Rapid double-click on "Add User" button produces exactly one modal instance
  - Uses single boolean state (showAddModal) — inherently idempotent
  - Close modal leaves no orphaned overlays (only normal layout ASIDE element)
  - Select All checkbox shows indeterminate state correctly
  - Zero console errors

- Feature #46: Users bulk selection and actions work ✅

  - Uncheck Select All deselects all, toolbar disappears
  - Select All shows indeterminate (mixed) state when only some selected
  - Selected rows get subtle primary highlight background
  - Zero console errors

## Implementation Notes
- Users page now uses local state (usersList) for add/delete operations
- Bulk selection uses Set<string> for O(1) lookups

- Indeterminate checkbox state set via ref callback
- Toast auto-dismisses after 4 seconds with close button
